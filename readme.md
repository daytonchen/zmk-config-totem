# Dayton's TOTEM ZMK 
## Start here if you are interested in the original board
[Here](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/totem) you can find the hardware files and build guide.

TOTEM is a 38 key column-staggered split keyboard running [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/) or [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm/). It's meant to be used with a SEEED XIAO BLE or RP2040. My configuration currently is using a SEEED XIAO BLE. 



## Details
Smarter people than me have spent a lot of time thinking about keymaps and layouts, lots of my setup borrows from [Robert U./ urob's wonderful writeups](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config)

Mostly mapped with the help of [nickcousts's 'keymap-editor'](https://github.com/nickcoutsos/keymap-editor) since I love a goood GUI and am afraid of text editors.

The layout is drawn using [caksoylar's 'keymap-drawer'](https://github.com/caksoylar/keymap-drawer)

## My current layout as drawn
